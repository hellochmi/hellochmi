Thanks for visiting my page.

I'm Michelle Chung. I recently graduated with my B.A. in Applied Mathematics and am currently enrolled at Georgia Tech for an M.Sc. in Computer Science.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing (badly), exercising, tidying, and spending time with friends.

I am passionate about learning, truth, and encouraging others towards curiosity through compassion.
