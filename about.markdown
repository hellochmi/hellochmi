Thanks for visiting my page.

I'm Michelle. I am currently enrolled at Georgia Tech for an M.Sc. in Computer Science and graduated with a B.A. in Applied Mathematics at CUNY Queens College.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing (badly), exercising, tidying, and spending time with friends.

I am passionate about learning, truth, and encouraging others towards curiosity through compassion.
